# Assignment 1 
C15329301 DT228/2

I decided for my project I would try incorperate a few different UI examples that I could think of.
My original idea was to model it after the Skyrim UI but realized that it wasn't exactly SCI FI and
it was more of a game. While the similiarities are there. I feel like I made it more appropriate to
the details of the assignment.

The biggest problem I had was actually with GIT which I should have resolved a lot earlier instead of
leaving it until it was too late. After I had commited a few times my git suddenly started saying 
that the upstream was not set and anytime I tried to set it, it would say it was referenced to another
repository. I had to remove that repository and start again and have since resolved and learned from 
those issues. I tried to re engineering different points of my project and commit them but that was
not as sucessful as I had hoped.

Overall I did feel I learned a lot from this project and it was actually quite interesting. Hours of
trial and error lead me to a project that while not 100% complete is at a level I am happy enough with
and I feel I have learned a lot from it.
